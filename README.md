# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋🏿 

My name is Tyrell Duku and I'm a second year Computing student at Imperial College London -- I'm Ghanaian-British and I live in East London 🇬🇭🇬🇧. Although my interests in Computer Science span a broad range of topics, I am currently taking courses in Data Science and as such a lot of my projects may reflect that!

## Interests & Hobbies 
- 🏆 I'm a big football fan and I aim to incorporate that in my future projects!
 - 🎮 I enjoy playing games on both [Xbox](https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/Profile?xr=socialtwistnav) and PlayStation.
 
 Feel free to follow/message me for collaboration or just to talk.
